The city's small medieval centre rapidly expanded as the Jordaan and the Canal District were constructed; the latter's cultural significance was acknowledged when it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the city expanded in all directions, with many new neighbourhoods and suburbs designed in modernist styles.\nAmsterdam is not the seat of the government, which is in <a data-id=\"The_Hague\" data-object_type=\"location\">The Hague</a>. Partly because of this, the city has an informal atmosphere unlike other capital cities its size. In fact, Amsterdam has a history of non-conformism, tolerance and progressivism.

It corresponds to the city as it was around 1850. Five major concentric canals ring the Binnenstad: Singel, Herengracht, Keizersgracht, Prinsengracht and Singelgracht, together forming the Canal District. Other districts inside the city centre are the Jordaan, a former working class area now popular with yuppies, and Plantage, a leafy and spacious area with botanical gardens and the zoo. The Nassaukade, Stadhouderskade and Mauritskade surround the city centre and mark the location of the former city moat and fortifications. Almost everything outside this line was built after 1870.\nThe semi-circle is on the south side of the IJ, which is often called a river but more exactly is an estuary. Going east from <a data-id=\"T__9731a3129d08\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Centraal Station</a>, the railway passes the artificial islands of the redeveloped <a data-id=\"T__cb7da2858a6e\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Eastern Docklands</a>. North of the IJ is mainly housing, although a major dockland redevelopment has started there too.\nThe river Amstel flows into the city from the south. Originally, it flowed along the line Rokin-Damrak. The dam in the Amstel, which gives the city its name, was located under the present Bijenkorf department store near <a data-id=\"W__34132635\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Dam Square</a>. The original settlement was on the right bank of the Amstel, on the present Warmoesstraat: it is therefore the oldest street in the city. The city has expanded in all directions, except to the northeast of the A10 ring motorway. That area is a protected rural landscape of open fields and small villages considered a part of the Waterland region.\nThe radius of the semi-circle is about 2 km. All major tourist destinations, and most hotels, are located inside it or just outside it. As a result, a large swathe of Amsterdam is not visited by the average tourist: at least 90% of the population lives outside this area. Most economic activity in Amsterdam\u2014the offices of the financial sector, the port\u2014is near or outside the ring motorway, which is 4\u20135 km from the centre.\nThe expansion of Amsterdam outside the ring motorway and the expansion of activity outside the city centre is redefining what locals consider the 'central area' of Amsterdam. Zuid, especially with the construction of the Noord/Zuidlijn and the Zuidas, is becoming more and more important in the daily lives of the locals. Its significance for tourists has increased by the now completed reconstruction work on the Museumplein and the adjoining museums.</p>", "image": { "source_id": "wikipedia", "source_url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/KeizersgrachtReguliersgrachtAmsterdam.jpg", "owner": "Massimo Catarinella", "owner_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KeizersgrachtReguliersgrachtAmsterdam.jpg", "license": "CC BY-SA 3.0", "caption": "Keizersgracht", "attribution": { "format": "{attribution} / {license}", "attribution_text": "Massimo Catarinella", "attribution_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KeizersgrachtReguliersgrachtAmsterdam.jpg", "license_text": "CC BY-SA 3.0", "license_link": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0" }, "sizes": { "original": { "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/KeizersgrachtReguliersgrachtAmsterdam.jpg", "width": 3456, "height": 2304, "bytes": 5144495, "format": "jpg" }, "medium": { "url": "http://api-images-www.triposo.com/20200405/gAAAAABet9O5zFzxkbny0V8oq9U5W22RSslE13X32MJo-wglv5asLwkjHv_lBlE9LMB3x-BJeLB6vTNsXhKUMjMdlQT4Z465q9SxvwanlG87DuEgaJYfrAqs5kOvdK7ohQ5H6ioevfnRbxPfy88GvAsMjuamj-Dw4qluJRymuwL_f6Vw_h8KvowKErm9nfYc30QW9Gm6od-agIC0tPAlxgnKuvcfoKI62g1S9QKyUylXD3mJanoJlavEKAtKbpNRcAZo6bJgVHtFMMAMYh0GWAD_1MjSy3ZK2jxjQmWLgDTif0q3yOjHMFA=", "width": 640, "height": 426, "bytes": 43558, "format": "jpg" }, "thumbnail": { "url": "http://api-images-www.triposo.com/20200405/gAAAAABet9O53wtNCZXWHAkS_XVS3wkF3uUjq-uekSiwfA2fXlMYJPeaJwXOVL7038OXkSF3jKspIL2othloh7IFWgsgiFJbsHqjTKvUlJKClMBgFOUZ5s7stea7RrG_RLaRgjjDBij7nthSo7qDWBp0WqLELQGLuhgdeeKk_MpXWbPetGnF-Ubt6Owha6cr_d6AXTxQBp9QqngTQliLZrzxVyf-r7nrakbYUXEmAYz0K9B5QSyK298UyokjUi9x_T5NAM9NCPmDMzVlCpIvWMZJx9kZk3pqSQ==", "width": 192, "height": 128, "bytes": 7092, "format": "jpg" } } } }, { "title": "History", "body": "<p>Amsterdam was first referred to as <i>Aemstelledamme</i> (\"dam on the Amstel\") in 1204, and known as <i>Aemsterdam</i> by 1327. It was first part of Utrecht, and around 1300 Gwijde van Henegouwen, bishop of Utrecht, gave Amsterdam city rights. After his death, the city was inherited by Count William III and became a part of Holland. Two fires swept the city in 1421 and 1452, and few wooden buildings from this period remain. A notable exception is the <i><a data-id=\"T__a2ce89a114b3\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Houten Huis</a></i> (Wooden House) at the Begijnhof.\nIn 1558, the Dutch started to revolt against the Spanish as the local nobility demanded more political power and religious freedom. Amsterdam supported the Spanish, but as it became more and more isolated and trade suffered accordingly, it switched sides in 1578. A relative freedom of religion emerged in the newly established Dutch Republic, and many migrants sought refuge in Amsterdam, including Jews from the Iberian Peninsula, merchants from Antwerp and <i>Huguenots</i> (French Protestants). Catholicism could not be practiced openly.\nAmsterdam prospered in the 17th century and became one of the world's great cities. A global trading network and overseas possessions made Amsterdam the centre of shipping in Europe and the world's leading financial centre. The arts flourished too, with great painters like Rembrandt producing works that are widely acclaimed as of this day. The city expanded outside of its original boundaries as the Canal Belt was constructed for wealthy merchants and the Jordaan for the working class. Immigrants formed the majority of the population and there was a strong immigration from Lutheran Protestant Germans.\nThe Dutch Republic was not a unitary state, but a confederation in which the independent provinces and the larger cities were politically autonomous. There was a strong animosity between the Orange faction with its power base in <a data-id=\"The_Hague\" data-object_type=\"location\">The Hague</a> and the republican faction with Amsterdam as its most outspoken representative, up to the point that the city was beleaguered by the army. The Orange faction supported the idea of hereditary political leadership vested in the princes of Orange as Stadtholders, while the republican faction supported civic independence. This long-standing culture of republicanism and non-conformism against the political elites in <a data-id=\"The_Hague\" data-object_type=\"location\">The Hague</a> exists to this day.\nThe 18th and 19th centuries were a turbulent period for Amsterdam. The economy suffered from decreased trade opportunities with the colonies and ongoing wars with the United Kingdom and France. Napoleon's brother Louis was crowned King of Holland in 1806 and took possession of the city hall on <a data-id=\"W__34132635\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Dam Square</a>, from then on referred to as the Royal Palace. The Netherlands was fully annexed by France in 1810, and Napoleon crowned Amsterdam \"third city\" of the French Empire. Prussian and Russian troops liberated the Netherlands, but it remained a unitary state and a monarchy, that now included Belgium.\nWhile <a data-id=\"The_Hague\" data-object_type=\"location\">The Hague</a> had functioned as <i>de facto</i> capital of the Republic, Amsterdam (together with Brussels) became the new capital of the Kingdom. The appointment of Amsterdam as the new capital was a conciliatory gesture of the Orange faction towards the city and a recognition of the strong civic and republican basis of the new Kingdom. <a data-id=\"The_Hague\" data-object_type=\"location\">The Hague</a> remained the seat of government and the political centre of the country. When Belgium seceded in 1830, Amsterdam became the sole capital and got the rights to trade with the country's overseas possessions.\nThe <a data-id=\"T__a392d1ae44ee\" data-object_type=\"poi\">North Sea Canal</a> and Noordhollandsch Kanaal connected Amsterdam's harbour directly with the Rhine and the North Sea. The Industrial Revolution arrived around 1860, which led to strong economic growth, but also to overpopulation as the city could not cope with the sudden demographic surge. The Jordaan was a notorious working class slum in this period, and neighbourhood like <a data-id=\"T__ec679eb4318e\" data-object_type=\"poi\">De Pijp</a> were built to provide housing as cheaply and quickly as possible for the lower middle class. Social issues that arose in this period made Amsterdam the centre of social democracy in the country.\nIn World War II, German troops occupied the city and more than 100,000 Jews were deported to death camps, most famously <a data-id=\"T__bbd12f203c11\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Anne Frank</a>. The diamond trade, before the war one of Amsterdam's top industries, almost completely disappeared as these businesses were mostly in the hands of Jews. The cultural revolution of the 1960s and 1970s changed Amsterdam radically. Soft drugs were tolerated, squatting became commonplace and riots with the police occurred on a daily basis. The coronation of Queen Beatrix in 1980 turned violent as protesters demanded a stop to the housing demolition that took place for the construction of Amsterdam's first metro line.\nIn subsequent decades, Amsterdam has lost some of its revolutionary appeal, becoming a centre for wealthy yuppies. Once poor districts like the Jordaan became upper class districts, and poorer inhabitants moved out of the centre to the outer boroughs and other cities. The city's once progressive ideals have faded as squatting is cracked down on, coffeeshops are increasingly closed and prostitution is outlawed outside of the Red Light District. However, it is still a progressive and tolerant city by international standards. Its culture of republicanism and non-conformism are going through tough times as well, but the ubiquitous \"Republic of Amsterdam\" street signs show that it remains a defining characteristic of the city.</p>", "image": { "source_id": "wikivoyage", "source_url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Paleis_op_de_Dam.jpg", "owner": "Coenvanderwoude", "owner_url": "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paleis_op_de_Dam.jpg", "license": "CC BY-SA 3.0", "caption": "Royal Palace", "attribution": { "format": "{attribution} / {license}", "attribution_text": "Coenvanderwoude", "attribution_link": "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paleis_op_de_Dam.jpg", "license_text": "CC BY-SA 3.0", "license_link": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0" }, "sizes": { "original": { "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Paleis_op_de_Dam.jpg", "width": 3456, "height": 2304, "bytes": 1640934, "format": "jpg" }, "medium": { "url": "http://api-images-www.triposo.com/20200405/gAAAAABet9O5RJprWolVqwNCOlamBx9rnWfwzzOT-HW8n_am2SbF4c7FHEUnDs0R2ssZQC9IdorrePHajHorungye21GeA99feXd65f_j3d59SRfuLK04q8Xeh-pb3mxMPrRqHKvkrjP0N9n8MpOtJOvm1a8gKfZDM5ldmO9LdXz5fFa7WCzLDrpzRQ6l_ERXDXV8jOpEdZ6rWGGjzsba5ByDCqy6gNcJ2oHfzcLkATBHi48nZCdnsYcyNqrFmdMnzXuJwNcaWFgEDL3_J4tTESemoK-8jgFfArK41bC1BSQlE1YgqoSqOM=", "width": 640, "height": 426, "bytes": 49991, "format": "jpg" }, "thumbnail": { "url": "http://api-images-www.triposo.com/20200405/gAAAAABet9O5yXINNYttIkM2JBmwcFUPzJDmme_xU4o1ckrn3ExXLBFMvMTmw_H-f4vkRdQ0cEQBuTOouHkAqFKSUSAl2QReH4EdbGD43JB-DeTwCe3tvtG8k_6B18prrVVv68E3YhrrAomPIXynxyH8grnJ_StpHA9gtUEASyB620Nw-DpaQx_zW6oya_vs3jpaQoVhG__BuCas65nSCHp7txcC7AR1n7QkZYaSM_wM1G6TIMs1ZrfeETUOG4wxvCWNlMF9rH1E_emV8FNfeOjAaz9U9WFUIQ==", "width": 192, "height": 128, "bytes": 6626, "format": "jpg" } } } }, { "title": "Climate", "body": "<p>Amsterdam is a large city and a major tourist destination, so you can visit it all year round.

The street pattern has been largely unchanged since the 19th century\u2014there was no major bombing during World War II. The centre consists of 90 islands linked by 400 bridges, some of them beautifully lit at night.\nThe inner part of the city centre, the Binnenstad, dates from medieval times. The oldest streets are the Warmoesstraat and the Zeedijk in the <i>Oudezijde</i> of the Binnenstad. As buildings were made of wood in the Middle Ages, not many of this period's buildings have survived. Two <b>medieval wooden houses</b> did survive though, at Begijnhof 34 and Zeedijk 1. Other old houses are Warmoesstraat 83 (built around 1400), Warmoesstraat 5 (around 1500) and Begijnhof 2-3 (around 1425). The <b>Begijnhof</b> is a late-medieval enclosed courtyard with the houses of beguines, Roman Catholic women living in a semi-religious community. Beguines are found in Northern France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and north-western Germany. House number 34 at the Begijnhof is the oldest home in Amsterdam. Entry to the courtyard and surrounding gardens is free, but be careful not to disturb the local community still living here.\nOne of the most prominent features is the Canal District, a concentric ring of canals built in the 17th century. The merchant-based oligarchy that ruled the trading city of Amsterdam built canal houses and mansions in the most prestigious locations here, especially along the main canals. Typical for the country are its traditional white draw bridges. The best example has to be the <b><a data-id=\"N__1390742293\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Magere Brug</a></b>, which is over 300 years old and nearly in its original capacity. It is a beautiful place to overlook the river and take in some traditional Dutch architecture.\nThe Jordaan was built around 1650 along with the Canal District, but not for the wealthy merchants. For a long time it was considered a typical working-class area, and included some notorious slums. The name probably derives from the nickname 'Jordan' for the Prinsengracht. Apart from a few wider canals, the streets are narrow, in an incomplete grid pattern (as the grid followed the lines of the former polders located here in medieval times). This district is the best example of \"gentrification\" in the Netherlands, becoming a hip boutique district.\nThere are several <b>large warehouses</b> for more specific uses. The biggest is the Admiralty Arsenal (1656-1657), now <b><a data-id=\"W__57863304\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Het Scheepvaartmuseum</a></b> at Kattenburgerplein. Others include the former turf warehouses (1550) along the Nes, now the municipal pawn office; a similar warehouse at Waterlooplein 69-75 (Arsenaal, 1610), now an architectural academy, and the warehouse of the West India Company (1642) at the corner of <a data-id=\"T__62b07ae22d19\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Prins Hendrikkade</a> and 's-Gravenhekje.

This led to a large migration of Jews, Huguenots (French Protestants), Flemings, Poles and other people to the city. Jews in particular had a large presence in Amsterdam, notably in the Jodenbuurt, though this quarter has changed significantly after World War II. The most prominent synagogue is <b>The Esnoga</b> (or <i>The <a data-id=\"N__441674928\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Portuguese Synagogue</a></i>), built in 1675 in an austere Classicist style.\nAs the Netherlands was a Protestant nation, most of the churches are from this branch of Christianity.

It was built in 1306, and became a Calvinist church after the Reformation in 1578.

From the 17th century onwards, four compass churches were built that would serve the areas outside the Binnenstad.\nThe late-medieval city also had smaller chapels such as the <a data-id=\"T__b456b436f410\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Sint Olofskapel</a> (circa 1440) on Zeedijk, and convent chapels such as the Agnietenkapel on the <a data-id=\"T__91ae1823aca6\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Oudezijds Voorburgwal</a> 231 (originally 1470), now the University of Amsterdam museum. Later churches included the Oosterkerk (1669) in the eastern islands, and the heavily restored Lutheran Church on the Singel (1671), now used by a hotel as a conference centre. Catholic churches were long forbidden, and built again only in the 19th-century. The most prominent is the Neo-Baroque Church of St. Nicholas (1887) opposite <a data-id=\"T__9731a3129d08\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Centraal Station</a>. Also, investigate some of the \"hidden churches\" found in Amsterdam, mainly Catholic churches that remained in activity following the Reformation. A prominent hidden church is <b><a data-id=\"N__34050788\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Ons' Lieve Heer op Solder</a></b>. Well worth the visit.

The <a data-id=\"T__ad2b2859489d\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Amsterdam School</a> is a style of Expressionist architecture that arose from 1910 through about 1930. Examples can be found in De Baarsjes in West and the Rivierenbuurt in Zuid.\nA completely different approach to architecture has been followed in the Bijlmer, a huge architectural project undertaken in the 1970s. A series of nearly identical high-rise buildings were laid out in a hexagonal grid with a strict separation of pedestrian and car traffic. It has been a revolutionary way of thinking in the architectural world, but within a decade the district started to make headlines with crime and robberies. As these high-rises are being torn down, the safety situation has improved, and now modern office buildings are taking their place.\nThe 1990s and 2000s also left its mark as a revolutionary time in architectural design.

The influence of the Dutch colonial past is apparent, as can be seen in the wide array of Indonesian and Surinamese restaurants. As in other cities with a large number of tourists, better value can often be found in streets that are not main tourist corridors.\nMost Asian restaurants are clustered at the <b>Zeedijk</b> near the Nieuwmarkt and it is often dubbed as Amsterdam's Chinatown. It's also home to many <i>tokos</i>, small Asian grocery stores that sell Eastern food and spices. Chinatown offers plenty of Chinese, Thai and Japanese restaurants, usually good value. Indonesian restaurants are usually of excellent quality, but Indian ones can be expensive. For a budget meal, check out the various Middle Eastern restaurants around the <b>Damstraat</b> and <b>Muntplein</b>. The numerous falafel bars have a good value, often sporting an \"all you can pile\" salad bar.\nSurinamese food is widely available and worth a try. The highest concentration of Surinamese restaurants can be found in Zuid and Zuidoost, especially in the <b>Albert Cuypstraat</b>. Locals recommend the <i>roti met bonen</i>, <i>moksi meti</i>, <i>petjil</i> and <i>bojo</i> as dessert. Try the <i>dawet</i> as well; this typical drink is made from milk, coconut milk and rose sirup and has sago balls in it. Most kids like it. <i>Dawet</i> can also be found in many Indonesian restaurants.\nThe Lange Leidsedwarsstraat (just off Leidseplein) has about five Italian restaurants that sell pasta or pizza for among many tourist traps.

Also worth trying is the <a data-id=\"T__a56b324d22fd\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Van Woustraat</a> in De Pijp, or continue to the Rijnstraat in the Rivierenbuurt.

Coffeeshops (in English, but written as one word; not to be confused with coffeehouses or cafes) are allowed to sell <b>cannabis</b> and hash for personal use (not more than 5 grams). While <i>technically</i> still illegal, mostly to comply with international treaties, personal use of (soft) drugs are regulated by the Ministry of Justice under an official policy of <i>gedogen</i>; literally this means <i>to accept</i> or <i>tolerate</i>, legally it is a doctrine of non-prosecution on the basis that action taken would be so highly irregular as to constitute selective prosecution. The city council of Amsterdam allows coffeeshops to operate only with the provision of set, non-transferable licenses as shown by an official green and white sticker on the window of a coffeeshop. Coffeeshops are to sell only soft drugs (such as cannabis), selling of other drugs is not allowed. Also selling of dried hallucinogenic mushrooms is not allowed.\nThere are about 250 coffeeshops in Amsterdam, most of them in the Binnenstad. Marijuana is mostly sold in one-gram increments with a maximum limit of 5 grams per transaction. Prices hover around for 1 gram, with the average joint holding around 0.33g. Most coffeeshops are happy to recommend varieties and prepare your joint for you. Some offer vaporizers/inhalators for people who don't want to smoke. Smoking paraphernalia (grinders, rolling papers, bongs, vaporizers, etc.) is usually available upon request. It is common practice not to smoke at a coffeeshop without purchasing something from the establishment first, be it coffee, a Coke, or marijuana. All coffeeshops do, indeed, sell coffee as well. ID is requested upon entrance to each establishment, and more often than not the only acceptable ID (except for Dutch citizens) is a passport.\nMany coffeeshops offer a 'smoking lounge' where soft drugs may be used. Despite the confusion on the subject, the country-wide smoking ban applies only to tobacco. However, since the Dutch commonly smoke tobacco mixed with their marijuana or hash, many coffeeshops, especially those unaccustomed to tourists, may require all smoking to be done in a separated smoking section or outdoors. Most central coffeeshops with large tourist client\u00e8les will allow marijuana or hash smoking in their entire space, requiring you to smoke in the separated section only if your joint contains tobacco. Many coffeeshops also provide a non-tobacco herbal filler for those who find pure joints too strong. You may usually smoke joints containing this herbal filler anywhere within the coffeeshop although individual house rules may vary. If in doubt, always ask the staff.\nAmsterdam hosts the Cannabis Cup, the most important marijuana related event in the world every year during the week of Thanksgiving. The Cannabis Cup is organized by High Times magazine, and offers both tourists and natives the chance to enjoy 5 days of consuming and judging marijuana in different forms. Participants are eligible to pay $199 in advance or at the door to obtain a \"judges pass\", which allows entry to the event for all five days, admission to numerous concerts and seminars held during the event, the ability to vote on numerous awards that are handed out, and free bus tours to and from the event. Day passes are available for for each day, and certain concerts sell tickets at the door provided they are not already sold out.</p>", "image": { "source_id": "wikivoyage", "source_url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Three_space_brownies.jpg", "owner": "Stas2k", "owner_url": "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Three_space_brownies.jpg", "license": "Public domain", "caption": "\"Hash brownies\", cakes containing hashish, purchased at three different Amsterdam coffeeshops in 2007", "attribution": { "format": "{attribution} / {license}", "attribution_text": "Stas2k", "attribution_link": "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Three_space_brownies.jpg", "license_text": "Public domain", "license_link": null }, "sizes": { "original": { "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Three_space_brownies.jpg", "width": 3008, "height": 2000, "bytes": 1362379, "format": "jpg" }, "medium": { "url": "http://api-images-www.triposo.com/20200405/gAAAAABet9O5W4ZjdPa6OEC61pVCl1FoHEsgacx10VKn3Ddf0IAgwyYlATLtVnQ_rrZRuBSX2JRabfkGsgNviLBLZPPl-Cz4kGHAEOd8MpTvqBpNaep7YeBLJ0DAhT6iZeIgi0AA4XD8-LeSElX2QVjX-lKjmmJ741mdkdevOo2BYCm_JE2Osx4NWOqf0ECOkd3w8CDL3Slqt-um69n-a80zyECbXmt-HkgIAnmc8DSslF_9lUy0s_fHw2xFEJVh4lMMnOU_SrUd606xN-96wpO4GAcaQg_h1m-2zisywdUoyjLwa100LDQ=", "width": 640, "height": 425, "bytes": 49433, "format": "jpg" }, "thumbnail": { "url": "http://api-images-www.triposo.com/20200405/gAAAAABet9O5JWMGi66AOyI5absEsvV55u7yaJiTffs6tXSzg3MfRsODieh-Wv_ePlgDrB6eJKnSdOdF7HlBAsBwqT_NT9Gs9oAEEjhIni3m6-EleEOQ5v1rBmLgN6b7LTeyZScl8RyBl_uyPTwqD-tkMEpI7djFwTGnDSesinvHnSj2qn5l2oQ8_8KC3h0vr7AWp53-C0ZWdTnB7Izm1SvLYlaWnrZHk3pPQJ0U6btb94njhvIhzG12W8daTMQlT3Ja1U5LpHI-UbwrUEtHFGgxqbV_pPPKzw==", "width": 192, "height": 127, "bytes": 7322, "format": "jpg" } } } }, { "title": "Red Light District", "body": "<p>The Red Light District consists of several canals, and the side streets between them, south of <a data-id=\"T__9731a3129d08\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Centraal Station</a> and east of Damrak.

Typically there is a lot of alcohol involved, sometimes mixed with other drugs. There is some speculation that fainting due to dropping blood pressure caused by the combination of relaxation from relieving oneself and sudden exposure to cold may be involved, but generally being blind drunk and completely unstable is a perfectly adequate explanation. So: peeing in a canal is not only unhygienic and antisocial, it's also potentially lethal if you're under the influence. Please pee in the place you are drinking or failing that at an outdoor urinal. If you really can't find one, do it against a tree (risking a fine) rather than in a canal (risking your life).</p>", "image": null }, { "title": "Neighbourhoods", "body": "<p>The city centre is generally safe, but there are differences between the neighbourhoods. Leidseplein and Rembrandtplein are the tourist traps of Amsterdam, so prices are relatively high and there are lots of scams. Zeedijk and Warmoesstraat had a reputation for gang violence and riots in the 1970s and 1980s, but the security situation has improved strongly and now it is safe to visit.\nBe cautious in the <b>Red Light District</b>. All kinds of people walk around there during the day, including families with children, but the area does attract seedier visitors and vagrants after sunset. As a tourist hotspot the area attracts a lot of pickpockets. <b>Do not take photographs of the prostitutes</b>, you will be yelled at or worse.

This is also true for the Kalverstraat and Nieuwendijk, even though shops are lit all night.\nThe outer boroughs have profound differences in safety levels. Nieuw-West and Zuidoost still have a bruised image regarding violence and harassment. Urban renewal projects have improved conditions, but you should still be aware of the situation. Noord also has some rougher neighbourhoods, but the rural parts are safe. Oost is largely safe, but there are some neighbourhoods east of Oosterpark where some travelers might not feel comfortable. Zuid is perfectly safe, even at night.\nNeighbourhoods with a bad reputation might still be worth seeking out, but be cautious at day and avoid at night.

If you're not a smoker, and you really want to try it, start with something light, make sure you don't have an empty stomach, and don't combine it with any other drugs or intoxicants, including alcohol. Be forthright with the counter person about your inexperience, they see it all the time. Go with an experienced person if you can. Regardless of the strength, your first experience can be quite a sensation at first, but will quickly decrease in intensity. You may want to plan to return to your hotel and \"hole up\" for a couple hours until you become comfortable with the feeling. If you do find yourself too strongly under the influence\u2014feeling nauseated, woozy or faint\u2014drink orange juice or eat something sweet like cookies or candy, and get fresh air. Dutch-grown <i>nederwiet</i> (a.k.a. super skunk) is much stronger than you might expect, even if you are experienced. The THC level can be as high as 15%, twice the norm.\nQuality varies. Coffeeshops aimed at tourists are more likely to have overpriced and poor quality products. A simple rule of thumb is: if the place looks good and well-kept chances are their wares will be good as well. Don't just enter a coffeeshop being overwhelmed that it's possible at all to buy and consume cannabis openly: be discerning as to the quality. Coffeeshops sell only soft drugs such as marijuana and hash\u2014asking for other drugs is pointless because coffeeshops are watched closely by the authorities, and nothing will get them closed faster than having hard drugs for sale.\nThere's a small chance you will be approached by people offering to sell you hard drugs in the street, especially as you are walking through the Red Light District. Ignoring (or failing that, a firm refusal) is enough\u2014they will not pester you. The selling of drugs in the street is illegal and often dangerous; moreover the drugs sold to strangers are usually fake. When they invite you to see the goods, they can lure you into a narrow street and rob you.\nThe usage of <b>magic mushrooms</b> has been forbidden since December 2008. So-called <b>smartshops</b> do not sell any illegal products, but a range of dietary supplements, including 'herbal ecstasy'\u2014a legal attempt at an ecstasy pill alternative which is a complete waste of money with various more or less obscure psychedelic herbs and, despite the change in the law, one type of magic mushrooms. It is the latter which causes problems as people often underestimate their strength. Magic mushrooms have few physical risks attached to them, but can have a very strong short-acting psychological effect, which can either be great or very distressing, depending on your own mindset (e.g. if you are relaxed, have any serious worries, history of mental illness, etc.) and your surroundings (e.g. if you feel comfortable and safe in them).\nThe first time you try this should always be in a familiar and trusted environment, not on the streets of an unfamiliar city. If you do decide to try it please get informed first. <a href=\"http://www.consciousdreams.nl/\">Conscious Dreams</a>, the company that invented the entire concept of a 'smartshop' back in 1994 does this clearly and responsibly (without downplaying the possible risks just to sell more like some other shops do). Also plan well ahead, make sure you have thought out where you will be. Most recommended is going to a large park like the Vondelpark, the Rembrandtpark or the Amsterdamse Bos where it is quiet, and there is no risk from traffic. Make sure that being intoxicated will not endanger your safety, or that of anybody else. Be sure to make your purchase in a smartshop rather than a coffeeshop. They are better regulated and information is available from the attendants that work there. They are also of better quality and stronger potency than at the coffeeshops.\nIf you're not sure of how much to take, take a small dose. Then you'll know what your \"tolerance\" level is. People who have bad trips are those who take a dosage over their own tolerance level. Never take more than one packet of mushrooms\u2014usually half is good for your first time. A good smart shop can give you more information about this.</p>", "image": null }, { "title": "Pharmacies", "body": "<p>It might be surprisingly difficult to find a pharmacy in the centre, especially one open in the late afternoon.

Phone cards can be bought at post offices and some delis, although the cards are increasingly hard to find. The KPN booths are being replaced by newer models that will accept coins again. Blue/orange Telfort booths accept both coins and cards.\nIf you need to make a call and do not have access to a pay phone, local phone or hotel phone, it is best to go to a <b>phone shop</b> (<i>belwinkel</i>). Phone shops can be found all over the city. Outside the city centre, they mostly serve immigrants calling their home country at cheap rates. You can also use a calling service over the Internet like Skype.\nIf you have a simlock-free European GSM mobile phone (suitable for GSM 900/1800 networks), consider buying a <b>prepaid simcard</b>. You can buy these in any electronics store, and they are often the same price as buying a KPN phone booth card.

Coffeeshops are allowed to sell cannabis and hash for personal use, and Amsterdam has hundreds of these scattered over the city.\nThis does not mean that you can get away with anything in Amsterdam. In any case, public attitudes and official policy have hardened compared to some tourist perceptions. The number of coffeeshops has decreased significantly and new laws forbid the selling of dried hallucinogenic mushrooms.

It corresponds to the city as it was around 1850. Five major concentric canals ring the Binnenstad: Singel, Herengracht, Keizersgracht, Prinsengracht and Singelgracht, together forming the Canal District. Other districts inside the city centre are the Jordaan, a former working class area now popular with yuppies, and Plantage, a leafy and spacious area with botanical gardens and the zoo. The Nassaukade, Stadhouderskade and Mauritskade surround the city centre and mark the location of the former city moat and fortifications. Almost everything outside this line was built after 1870.</p>\n<p>The semi-circle is on the south side of the IJ, which is often called a river but more exactly is an estuary. Going east from <a data-id=\"T__9731a3129d08\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Centraal Station</a>, the railway passes the artificial islands of the redeveloped <a data-id=\"T__cb7da2858a6e\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Eastern Docklands</a>.

The original settlement was on the right bank of the Amstel, on the present Warmoesstraat: it is therefore the oldest street in the city.

That area is a protected rural landscape of open fields and small villages considered a part of the Waterland region.</p>\n<p>The radius of the semi-circle is about 2 km. All major tourist destinations, and most hotels, are located inside it or just outside it. As a result, a large swathe of Amsterdam is not visited by the average tourist: at least 90% of the population lives outside this area.

It was first part of Utrecht, and around 1300 Gwijde van Henegouwen, bishop of Utrecht, gave Amsterdam city rights. After his death, the city was inherited by Count William III and became a part of Holland. Two fires swept the city in 1421 and 1452, and few wooden buildings from this period remain. A notable exception is the <i><a data-id=\"T__a2ce89a114b3\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Houten Huis</a></i> (Wooden House) at the Begijnhof.</p>\n<p>In 1558, the Dutch started to revolt against the Spanish as the local nobility demanded more political power and religious freedom. Amsterdam supported the Spanish, but as it became more and more isolated and trade suffered accordingly, it switched sides in 1578. A relative freedom of religion emerged in the newly established Dutch Republic, and many migrants sought refuge in Amsterdam, including Jews from the Iberian Peninsula, merchants from Antwerp and <i>Huguenots</i> (French Protestants). Catholicism could not be practiced openly.</p>\n<p>Amsterdam prospered in the 17th century and became one of the world's great cities. A global trading network and overseas possessions made Amsterdam the centre of shipping in Europe and the world's leading financial centre. The arts flourished too, with great painters like Rembrandt producing works that are widely acclaimed as of this day. The city expanded outside of its original boundaries as the Canal Belt was constructed for wealthy merchants and the Jordaan for the working class. Immigrants formed the majority of the population and there was a strong immigration from Lutheran Protestant Germans.</p>\n<p>The Dutch Republic was not a unitary state, but a confederation in which the independent provinces and the larger cities were politically autonomous. There was a strong animosity between the Orange faction with its power base in <a data-id=\"The_Hague\" data-object_type=\"location\">The Hague</a> and the republican faction with Amsterdam as its most outspoken representative, up to the point that the city was beleaguered by the army. The Orange faction supported the idea of hereditary political leadership vested in the princes of Orange as Stadtholders, while the republican faction supported civic independence. This long-standing culture of republicanism and non-conformism against the political elites in <a data-id=\"The_Hague\" data-object_type=\"location\">The Hague</a> exists to this day.</p>\n<p><img data-caption=\"Royal Palace\" data-index=\"2\"/>\nThe 18th and 19th centuries were a turbulent period for Amsterdam. The economy suffered from decreased trade opportunities with the colonies and ongoing wars with the United Kingdom and France. Napoleon's brother Louis was crowned King of Holland in 1806 and took possession of the city hall on <a data-id=\"W__34132635\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Dam Square</a>, from then on referred to as the Royal Palace. The Netherlands was fully annexed by France in 1810, and Napoleon crowned Amsterdam \"third city\" of the French Empire. Prussian and Russian troops liberated the Netherlands, but it remained a unitary state and a monarchy, that now included Belgium.</p>\n<p>While <a data-id=\"The_Hague\" data-object_type=\"location\">The Hague</a> had functioned as <i>de facto</i> capital of the Republic, Amsterdam (together with Brussels) became the new capital of the Kingdom. The appointment of Amsterdam as the new capital was a conciliatory gesture of the Orange faction towards the city and a recognition of the strong civic and republican basis of the new Kingdom. <a data-id=\"The_Hague\" data-object_type=\"location\">The Hague</a> remained the seat of government and the political centre of the country. When Belgium seceded in 1830, Amsterdam became the sole capital and got the rights to trade with the country's overseas possessions.</p>\n<p>The <a data-id=\"T__a392d1ae44ee\" data-object_type=\"poi\">North Sea Canal</a> and Noordhollandsch Kanaal connected Amsterdam's harbour directly with the Rhine and the North Sea. The Industrial Revolution arrived around 1860, which led to strong economic growth, but also to overpopulation as the city could not cope with the sudden demographic surge. The Jordaan was a notorious working class slum in this period, and neighbourhood like <a data-id=\"T__ec679eb4318e\" data-object_type=\"poi\">De Pijp</a> were built to provide housing as cheaply and quickly as possible for the lower middle class. Social issues that arose in this period made Amsterdam the centre of social democracy in the country.</p>\n<p>In World War II, German troops occupied the city and more than 100,000 Jews were deported to death camps, most famously <a data-id=\"T__bbd12f203c11\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Anne Frank</a>. The diamond trade, before the war one of Amsterdam's top industries, almost completely disappeared as these businesses were mostly in the hands of Jews. The cultural revolution of the 1960s and 1970s changed Amsterdam radically. Soft drugs were tolerated, squatting became commonplace and riots with the police occurred on a daily basis. The coronation of Queen Beatrix in 1980 turned violent as protesters demanded a stop to the housing demolition that took place for the construction of Amsterdam's first metro line.</p>\n<p>In subsequent decades, Amsterdam has lost some of its revolutionary appeal, becoming a centre for wealthy yuppies. Once poor districts like the Jordaan became upper class districts, and poorer inhabitants moved out of the centre to the outer boroughs and other cities. The city's once progressive ideals have faded as squatting is cracked down on, coffeeshops are increasingly closed and prostitution is outlawed outside of the Red Light District. However, it is still a progressive and tolerant city by international standards. Its culture of republicanism and non-conformism are going through tough times as well, but the ubiquitous \"Republic of Amsterdam\" street signs show that it remains a defining characteristic of the city.\n</p>", "summary": "<p><img data-caption=\"Begijnhof\" data-index=\"1\"/>\nAmsterdam was first referred to as <i>Aemstelledamme</i> (\"dam on the Amstel\") in 1204, and known as <i>Aemsterdam</i> by 1327.

The centre consists of 90 islands linked by 400 bridges, some of them beautifully lit at night.</p>\n<p>The inner part of the city centre, the Binnenstad, dates from medieval times. The oldest streets are the Warmoesstraat and the Zeedijk in the <i>Oudezijde</i> of the Binnenstad. As buildings were made of wood in the Middle Ages, not many of this period's buildings have survived. Two <b>medieval wooden houses</b> did survive though, at Begijnhof 34 and Zeedijk 1. Other old houses are Warmoesstraat 83 (built around 1400), Warmoesstraat 5 (around 1500) and Begijnhof 2-3 (around 1425). The <b>Begijnhof</b> is a late-medieval enclosed courtyard with the houses of beguines, Roman Catholic women living in a semi-religious community. Beguines are found in Northern France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and north-western Germany. House number 34 at the Begijnhof is the oldest home in Amsterdam. Entry to the courtyard and surrounding gardens is free, but be careful not to disturb the local community still living here.</p>\n<p>One of the most prominent features is the Canal District, a concentric ring of canals built in the 17th century. The merchant-based oligarchy that ruled the trading city of Amsterdam built canal houses and mansions in the most prestigious locations here, especially along the main canals. Typical for the country are its traditional white draw bridges. The best example has to be the <b><a data-id=\"N__1390742293\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Magere Brug</a></b>, which is over 300 years old and nearly in its original capacity. It is a beautiful place to overlook the river and take in some traditional Dutch architecture.</p>\n<p>The Jordaan was built around 1650 along with the Canal District, but not for the wealthy merchants. For a long time it was considered a typical working-class area, and included some notorious slums. The name probably derives from the nickname 'Jordan' for the Prinsengracht. Apart from a few wider canals, the streets are narrow, in an incomplete grid pattern (as the grid followed the lines of the former polders located here in medieval times). This district is the best example of \"gentrification\" in the Netherlands, becoming a hip boutique district.</p>\n<p>There are several <b>large warehouses</b> for more specific uses. The biggest is the Admiralty Arsenal (1656-1657), now <b><a data-id=\"W__57863304\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Het Scheepvaartmuseum</a></b> at Kattenburgerplein. Others include the former turf warehouses (1550) along the Nes, now the municipal pawn office; a similar warehouse at Waterlooplein 69-75 (Arsenaal, 1610), now an architectural academy, and the warehouse of the West India Company (1642) at the corner of <a data-id=\"T__62b07ae22d19\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Prins Hendrikkade</a> and 's-Gravenhekje.

Coffeeshops (in English, but written as one word; not to be confused with coffeehouses or cafes) are allowed to sell <b>cannabis</b> and hash for personal use (not more than 5 grams). While <i>technically</i> still illegal, mostly to comply with international treaties, personal use of (soft) drugs are regulated by the Ministry of Justice under an official policy of <i>gedogen</i>; literally this means <i>to accept</i> or <i>tolerate</i>, legally it is a doctrine of non-prosecution on the basis that action taken would be so highly irregular as to constitute selective prosecution. The city council of Amsterdam allows coffeeshops to operate only with the provision of set, non-transferable licenses as shown by an official green and white sticker on the window of a coffeeshop. Coffeeshops are to sell only soft drugs (such as cannabis), selling of other drugs is not allowed. Also selling of dried hallucinogenic mushrooms is not allowed.</p>\n<p>There are about 250 coffeeshops in Amsterdam, most of them in the Binnenstad. Marijuana is mostly sold in one-gram increments with a maximum limit of 5 grams per transaction. Prices hover around for 1 gram, with the average joint holding around 0.33g. Most coffeeshops are happy to recommend varieties and prepare your joint for you. Some offer vaporizers/inhalators for people who don't want to smoke. Smoking paraphernalia (grinders, rolling papers, bongs, vaporizers, etc.) is usually available upon request. It is common practice not to smoke at a coffeeshop without purchasing something from the establishment first, be it coffee, a Coke, or marijuana. All coffeeshops do, indeed, sell coffee as well. ID is requested upon entrance to each establishment, and more often than not the only acceptable ID (except for Dutch citizens) is a passport.</p>\n<p>Many coffeeshops offer a 'smoking lounge' where soft drugs may be used. Despite the confusion on the subject, the country-wide smoking ban applies only to tobacco. However, since the Dutch commonly smoke tobacco mixed with their marijuana or hash, many coffeeshops, especially those unaccustomed to tourists, may require all smoking to be done in a separated smoking section or outdoors. Most central coffeeshops with large tourist client\u00e8les will allow marijuana or hash smoking in their entire space, requiring you to smoke in the separated section only if your joint contains tobacco. Many coffeeshops also provide a non-tobacco herbal filler for those who find pure joints too strong. You may usually smoke joints containing this herbal filler anywhere within the coffeeshop although individual house rules may vary.
